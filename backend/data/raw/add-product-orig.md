### **Screen Description**

This screen represents the **Add New Product** interface of the *OrderSys* Order Management System. It enables users to create and register a new product (either goods, services, or other items) within the product catalog. The interface is designed with a two-column form layout that separates **product details**, **sales information**, and **purchase information**, making data entry structured and efficient.

The layout ensures clarity and logical grouping of fields for easy product onboarding and financial mapping.
